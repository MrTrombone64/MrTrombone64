- 👋 Hi, I’m @MrTrombone64
- 👀 I’m interested in Music, Gaming, and Entertainment at large.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all sorts of stuff, but trying to figure my way around the world of coding/programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can that I am able to!
- 📫 How to reach me: just hit me up by some means on this website, I'm sure there's something that exists.
